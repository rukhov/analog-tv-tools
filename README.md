# Analog TV Tools project
This project focuses on developing a suite of software tools for decoding analog TV signals. The current toolset includes two primary components:
- Command Line Interface (CLI) Decoder: This tool enables the conversion of digitized analog CVBS SECAM signals into standard AVI video files.
- GNU Radio Block: This component allows integration of the Analog TV decoder into GNU Radio (https://wiki.gnuradio.org/), facilitating its use within the GNU Radio ecosystem.

## Samples
